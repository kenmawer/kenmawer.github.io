<h1>Behold... a work in progress</h1>
<p>I'm Ken, a fourth year UBC student in mathematics and statistics. I am highly detail-oriented and have a drive to contribute, which is why I want to be a data analyst. I hope that upon graduating UBC, I can earn a graduate degree in statistics to gain the necessary statistical knowledge to analyze and contribute in my field.</p>
<p>I'm highly academically capable. I'm currently at a 92.5% (4.24/4.33) average for my upper year courses and have earned three scholarships for just one school year.</p>
<p>I'm driven through more than academics. I'm a co-op student who has done three terms of Arts Co-op and developed work experience, all while discovering my passions in data analysis. Now in Sciences Co-op, I also strive to develop my technical skills.</p>
<p>I'm not ending there. I strive to go on exchange to the University of Sydney in 2021 for a semester to develop my knowledge through courses in a different perspective to UBC and that may not be offered there. I also develop myself as I go to a different place.</p>
