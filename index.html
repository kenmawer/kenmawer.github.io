<h1>Behold... a work in progress</h1>
<p>I'm Ken, a fourth year UBC student in mathematics and statistics. I am highly detail-oriented and have a drive to contribute, which is why I want to be a data analyst. I hope that upon graduating UBC, I can earn a graduate degree in statistics to gain the necessary statistical knowledge to analyze and contribute in my field.</p>
